These .xmls are examples for how to use the universal build.xml.  They have been fully adapted to work with the mod that they are named after.
For example, `BuildCraft.xml` is meant to be compatible with BuildCraft.  Simply rename `BuildCraft.xml` to `build.xml`, and then drop it in your cloned BuildCraft repository\source.

Currently, there are examples for:
* [BuildCraft] (http://github.com/SirSengir/BuildCraft)
  * [Example .xml] (https://github.com/50Wliu/Universal-build.xml/blob/master/Examples/BuildCraft.xml)
* [Equivalent Exchange 3] (http://github.com/pahimar/Equivalent-Exchange-3)
  * [Example .xml] (https://github.com/50Wliu/Universal-build.xml/blob/master/Examples/Equivalent Exchange 3.xml)
