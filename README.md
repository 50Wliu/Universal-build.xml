Universal build.xml
===================
Update 11/25/2013 A.D.: So, I'm back.  Still pretty tied up with my other projects (and there's more than before), but I've managed to get some spare time to work on this :)

A universal build.xml for Minecraft mods that use Ant to compile.

**LATEST STABLE VERSION**: 4.1.1 (1/18/2013 A.D. 5:28 P.M.)

**LATEST UNSTABLE VERSION**: 5.0.0pre2 (1/31/2013 A.D. 8:57 P.M.)

I'm assuming that if you're here, you're either a MC mod developer, or just someone eager to use a better build.xml :P

So, why is this build.xml so awesome?
* Fast and Efficient
  * The very first build, where it downloads and installs Forge, takes maybe around 8-12 minutes.  The following builds will only take around 5!
* Easy to Use
  * If you're a mod developer, all you have to do is put in the necessary strings for the properties!  If you're a normal person, all you have to do is type in `ant`!
* Hands-off
  * Like stated previously, this needs absolutely NO interaction after typing in `ant`!  That means you can go do whatever you want!
* Easy to Understand
  * There are many comments, so even someone totally new should know what to do.
* Universal
  * Like the name states, this can be used for every Minecraft mod that uses Ant to compile!
