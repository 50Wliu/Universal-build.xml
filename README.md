Universal build.xml
===================
**IMPORTANT**:
-I've temporarily suspended work on this project, sorry guys, especially my 2 stargazers :(
-I've been *very* busy working on other projects for my [gaming community](http://www.50dkp.com/), mainly on [this](https://github.com/50DKP/FF2) project.
-I'll probably return to work once I stabilize that.  *Hopefully*.  Again, really sorry!

A universal build.xml for Minecraft mods that are using Ant to compile.

**LATEST STABLE VERSION**:  4.1.1 (1/18/2013 A.D. 5:28 P.M.)

**LATEST UNSTABLE VERSION**:  5.0.0pre2 (1/31/2013 A.D. 8:57 P.M.)

I'm assuming that if you're here, you're either a MC mod developer, or just someone eager to use a better build.xml :P

So, why is this build.xml so awesome?
* Fast and Efficient
  * The very first build, where it downloads and installs Forge, takes maybe around 8-12 minutes.  The following builds will only take around 5!
* Easy to Use
  * If you're a mod developer, all you have to do is put in the necessary strings for the properties!  If you're a normal person, all you have to do is type in `ant`!
* Hands-off
  * Like stated previously, this needs absolutely NO interaction after typing in `ant`!  That means you can go do whatever you want!
* Easy to Understand
  * There are many comments, so even someone totally new will know what to do!
* Universal
  * Like the name states, this can be used for every (I think) Minecraft mod that uses Ant to compile!
