-CRITICAL RELEASE!
-Fixed a ton of bugs.
-Reverted the Forge downloads once change, since Ant doesn't except that.  Will try to put it in another way.

-MCP and Forge should now download/install automatically for you.
-More properties to accomodate the above change.

-WARNING:  The echo messages may be messed up.  I didn't count Download Forge and Download Ant-Contrib as one.

VERSION 1.0.0 (12/11/2012 A.D. 5:45 P.M.):
-Initial release!
-*Should* be compatible with ALL Minecraft mods that use Ant to compile.
  -Contains many properties to configure the common directory, client directory, mod name, etc.
		-Don't have to change anything other than the properties and the project name!  (Unless you don't have a resources file or something)
-The .jar defaults to ${release.dir}\${mod.name} ${mod.version}.jar.
-Type "ant" to auto-compile, recompile, reobfuscate, build the .jar, and clean.
